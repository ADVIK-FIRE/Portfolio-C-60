        <b><p class="para">My hobby is to play badminton with my friends and papa in my free time. Playing badminton improves our motor skills and is also a way of recreation in the summer vacations. It also helps keep us fit and healthy. During the pandemic, there was absolutely no physicall activity which made most of us unhealthy, playing sports is a solution for this problem. At first I was too lazy to get up in the morning and go to the stadium but now I am comparitively more active and cheerful.
